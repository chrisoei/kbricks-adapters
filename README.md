One of the great things about 3D printing is that it allows you to bridge between manufactured product ecosystems. Once upon a time, Shop Vac vacuum cleaners worked with Shop Vac attachments and nothing else. PVC pipes worked with joins made for PVC pipes, but not with Shop Vac attachments, or with North American garden hoses, or gutter systems, or plastic soda bottles. 3D printing lets you create adapters, making everything play nicely with everything else.

This is a collection of adapters that uses the open source kbricks project (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3574234) as a backbone. It will (eventually) bridge between Command hooks, MOLLE systems, belt loops, and other systems.
